        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Invasion At Dawn is a co-op survival FPS developed in Unity, where players must defend a central point
            against waves of zombies. The multiplayer system is based on client/server authoritative control, which
            ensures a stable and fair gameplay experience. We used the Riptide networking framework to create a seamless
            online environment, with configurations for weapons, wave difficulty, and upgrades. The zombies' movement
            and attack patterns evolve with each wave, increasing in complexity and requiring strategic teamwork.</p>

    <section class="contribution">
        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As the network programmer, I handled all aspects of multiplayer networking. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up the multiplayer architecture using the Riptide networking framework, which provided a stable
                basis for client/server authoritative control.
            </li>
            <li>Ensuring reliable player interaction, game state synchronization, and data transfer between clients and
                the server for a smooth co-op experience.
            </li>
            <li>Designing configurable elements for gameplay, including weapon pricing, wave settings, and other
                customizable game mechanics, allowing easy tuning for balanced gameplay.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Team Contributions</h3>
        <p>Our team consisted of four members, each with specific roles:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elias:</strong> As the gameplay programmer, Elias focused on implementing core gameplay
                mechanics, such as player movement, weapon handling, and combat interactions. He designed and coded the
                combat system, ensuring smooth and responsive controls, and collaborated with me to integrate networking
                with these gameplay elements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Felix:</strong> Felix was responsible for game audio and UI implementation, using Wwise for
                dynamic soundscapes that enhanced the horror atmosphere. He set up audio cues for zombies and weapon
                feedback, integrated UI elements like health bars, ammo indicators, and other HUD components, creating
                an immersive player interface.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Zey:</strong> Zey was in charge of 3D modeling, bringing the world of Invasion At Dawn to life
                with detailed environment assets and realistic zombie models. She designed models that fit the dark and
                suspenseful theme, created various zombie types, and ensured all assets were optimized for performance
                and visual appeal within Unity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Note: </b>During most of the project time, Elias and me worked together on both, networking and gameplay programming</p>
