        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Protect Santa's Anvil was a solo project created in Unity during a week-long Christmas game jam. The game is a tower defense-style experience set in snowy, mountainous terrain, generated using Perlin noise. Players defend Santa's anvil, which he uses to craft gifts, from waves of enemy elves controlled by a villain. An elf transporting the anvil has crashed, leaving it vulnerable, so the player builds toy defenses to stop the villain’s minions.</p>

        <h2>Learning Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Developing Protect Santa's Anvil was a valuable experience in managing all aspects of game development independently. From generating terrain and modeling assets to implementing a currency system and particle effects, this project strengthened my technical and artistic skills. Working on each element myself provided a deeper understanding of Unity’s capabilities and the planning required for a cohesive game.</p>
