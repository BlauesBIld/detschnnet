    <section class="game-overview">
        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Basketball Shooter Race is a solo mobile game project where players have 60 seconds to score as many baskets as possible by swiping up on the screen. Playable in solo mode or against AI, the game requires precision in swipe distance to match the left-side indicator for accurate shots. The project involved a mix of self-modeled and outsourced assets, and combined arcade elements with physics-based trajectory for an engaging gameplay experience.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Swiping Indicator:</strong> A bar on the left shows the swipe distance, with target zones for perfect and backboard shots.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Point Backboard:</strong> Random backboard glow for a limited time grants double points on successful shots.</li>
            <li><strong>Fireball Effect:</strong> Consecutive hits activate a fireball effect, boosting score potential for a limited duration.</li>
        </ul>
