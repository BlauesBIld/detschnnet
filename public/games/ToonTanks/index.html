        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>In Toon Tanks, players control a tank navigating through obstacles and defeating turrets. This Unreal
            Engine project focused on foundational C++ skills, Unreal Engine mechanics, and Blueprints, providing a
            comprehensive look at game development basics in Unreal.</p>

            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>Used components to structure the tank's behavior and interactions with the environment.</p>

            <h3>Actors and Scenes</h3>
            <p>Learned how to work with Actors for both player and enemy elements, and managed them in different
                levels and scenes.</p>

            <h3>Game Mode & Player Pawn</h3>
            <p>Customized game modes and created Player Pawn classes to define the core gameplay loop and player
                abilities.</p>

            <h3>Collision Handling</h3>
            <p>Integrated collision detection for interactions between the tank, turrets, and obstacles, allowing
                precise gameplay elements.</p>

        <h2>Learning Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This project was a strong foundation for understanding the fundamentals of Unreal Engine, from
            programming in C++ to utilizing Blueprints for visual scripting. It allowed me to see how engine
            features like collision detection, component management, and asset integration combine to create a
            cohesive game experience.</p>
