        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Mini RPG is a 3D multiplayer co-op game developed as a solo project, where players team up to clear dungeons, gather coins, and expand a hexagon-based platform in the main world. Using a custom-built networking solution with TCP and UDP, the game balances both server and client authority for optimized performance. Players access different dungeons through a central portal, with each platform featuring randomized loot chests, diverse biomes, and unique structures to explore and conquer.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Networking Solution:</strong> TCP and UDP protocols handle player interactions with a mix of server and client authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Dungeon Clearing:</strong> Players explore and defeat dungeon enemies to earn coins and progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Expansion:</strong> Coins are used to unlock new hexagonal platforms with unique biomes and layouts in the main world.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Portal:</strong> A portal allows players to enter the current dungeon, with different dungeons available over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Loot Chests:</strong> Each platform features a chest with randomly generated items for players to collect.</li>
