        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Sync Or Sink</em> is a 2-player co-op Cold War submarine game about communication under pressure.
            One player is the <strong>Captain</strong>, confined to the cockpit—navigating by instruments, reading alarms,
            and guiding the mission. The other is the <strong>Engineer</strong>, moving through the submarine to diagnose and
            repair failures. A walkie-talkie style voice system (with custom high-pass/low-pass filters) forces clear,
            concise callouts as the Captain relays navigation and faults while the Engineer reports findings and fixes systems
            before time runs out.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Team & Release:</strong> Built by a 6-person team. <strong>Published</strong> (PC). I served as the <strong>Lead Programmer</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asymmetric 2-Player Roles:</strong> Captain (cockpit-locked navigation, instruments, alarms) and Engineer (free movement, inspections, repairs).</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth &amp; Survival:</strong> Manage speed, depth, and power usage to keep systems stable and avoid catastrophic failures.</li>
            <li><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Captain interprets warnings and maps/diagrams; Engineer verifies on-site and reports exact conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Repair Loops:</strong> Replace parts, reroute power, seal leaks, and restore subsystems under time pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication-First Design:</strong> Walkie-talkie push-to-talk with limited bandwidth encourages disciplined comms and clear procedures.</li>

        <h2>Learning Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            Designing strict role asymmetry taught the value of instrument-driven UI and spatial task design.
            The filtered VOIP system directly shaped teamwork quality, while fault cascades stress-tested replication,
            task orchestration, and recovery flows—key lessons for shipping a tight, communication-centric co-op experience.
