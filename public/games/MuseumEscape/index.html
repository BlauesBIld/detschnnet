        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Museum Escape was developed in Godot as part of the Culture Game Jam 2024. This narrative-driven platformer follows a janitor who finds himself mysteriously trapped in a museum. While searching for an exit, he gets pulled into various paintings, entering unique jump-and-run levels inspired by each piece of artwork. Each level combines platforming mechanics with a new visual theme inspired by art history, offering players a blend of challenge and artistic discovery.</p>

        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>In Museum Escape, I was responsible for 2D art creation, gaining a new perspective by working as an artist rather than as a programmer. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing pixel art assets, including character sprites, environments, and interactive elements, to fit each levelâ€™s unique artistic theme.</li>
            <li>Ensuring a cohesive visual style across different levels, while adapting pixel art to represent various historical art styles accurately.</li>
            <li>Communicating and collaborating with the programming team, allowing me to experience how artists work with developers to ensure assets align with gameplay requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Team Contributions</h3>
        <p>Our team brought together both artistic and technical expertise:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filip:</strong> Also focused on 2D art, Filip contributed to the creation of backgrounds, character designs, and environmental details that enhanced the game's aesthetic appeal.</li>
            <li><strong>Bayram:</strong> As a programmer, Bayram was responsible for implementing gameplay mechanics, ensuring that platforming elements and interactions functioned smoothly.</li>
            <li><strong>Robin:</strong> Also responsible for programming, Robin worked on integrating the level transitions and interactions within the art-themed environments, ensuring the game ran cohesively.</li>
        </ul>
