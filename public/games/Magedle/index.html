        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Magedle is a web-based defense game developed from scratch in plain JavaScript, featuring a custom engine built with canvas rendering. The player takes on the role of a mage tasked with defending their village from waves of monsters. With each wave, players gain experience points and items, while also having the opportunity to purchase upgrades from a traveling merchant. This project was a complete solo effort, where every element—from the UI to the game loop and collision detection—was developed independently.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wave-Based Combat:</strong> Enemies approach from the top in waves, and players must defeat them before they reach the village barrier.</li>
            <li><strong>Collecting Drops:</strong> Monsters drop equippable items and gold coins, which players can collect between waves.</li>
            <li><strong>Stats and Levels:</strong> Gaining XP increases the player's level and base stats, including magic damage, spell cast rate, and critical hit chance.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Left-Click Combat:</strong> The player attacks using basic left-click fireballs to fend off the advancing enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Traveling Merchant:</strong> Between waves, a merchant may appear, offering items in exchange for collected gold coins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Developing Magedle as a solo project was a valuable experience in end-to-end game creation, from building a custom engine to designing every aspect of gameplay and visuals. The project strengthened my understanding of JavaScript and canvas, as well as core game development principles such as collision detection and game loop management.</p>
