        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>AI Text Dungeon is an interactive Android game where players craft a unique story by inputting descriptions that shape the dungeon adventure. Using the ChatGPT API, the app dynamically generates narrative responses to match user inputs, creating an open-ended gameplay experience. Developed as a two-person project, the game combines real-time AI responses with an immersive UI, delivering a highly personalized journey.</p>
