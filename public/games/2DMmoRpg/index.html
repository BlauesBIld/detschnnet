        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>2D MMO RPG was an ambitious multiplayer project developed in Unity by myself and a teammate, Thomas, who was new to Unity. The game aimed to bring an MMO experience to a 2D space with custom-built networking using TCP and UDP protocols for server-authoritative gameplay. Although the project stayed in its early stages, we implemented core MMO mechanics, from inventory management to basic combat and UI elements for player stats.</p>

    <section class="contribution">
        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I led much of the coding and Unity development, given my prior experience. I worked on the networking solution, implemented server-authoritative features, and developed UI elements for health, mana, and experience, as well as the inventory and hotbar systems.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Team Contributions</h3>
        <p>The project was a collaborative effort:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thomas:</strong> Assisted in coding various gameplay elements and UI, gaining experience with Unity as we developed the game together.</li>
            <li><strong>Artist:</strong> Provided a few assets, while the majority of art assets were outsourced to match the gameâ€™s aesthetic needs.</li>
        </ul>
